# Job Scraper Service

This directory will contain the job scraping service for the AI Job Assistant platform.

## Planned Features

- **Web Scraping**: Automated job posting collection from various job boards
- **Data Processing**: Clean and structure scraped job data
- **API Integration**: RESTful API for job data access
- **Scheduling**: Automated scraping with configurable intervals
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful scraping with proper delays
- **Data Storage**: Integration with the main database

## Architecture

The job scraper will be designed as a microservice that:
- Runs independently from the main backend
- Communicates via REST API
- Stores data in the shared PostgreSQL database
- Uses Redis for caching and job queues

## Development Status

This service is currently in planning phase. The directory structure and implementation will be added as development progresses.

## Integration Points

- **Backend API**: Will provide job data to the main backend
- **Database**: Will store scraped job postings
- **Frontend**: Will display scraped jobs in the job management interface

## Future Implementation

When implemented, this service will include:
- Scraping engines for major job boards
- Data validation and cleaning
- Duplicate detection
- Search and filtering capabilities
- API endpoints for job data access
